### Hi there 👋 I'm Jinen!

Welcome to my GitHub profile - I'm an aspiring penetration tester and data scientist. I also develop apps!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tensorflow, PyTorch
- 💻 I code primarily in Python, C++ and Java
- 📫 How to reach me: an email to jinens8@gmail.com works best!
- 💾 My CV: [Here](https://github.com/jinensetpal/jinensetpal/raw/master/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf)!

\* I run automated CI/CD commits, the commit history looks misleading 😝
