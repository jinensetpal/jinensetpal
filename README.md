## Hello 👋🏼 I'm Jinen!




I'm a third-year undergraduate @ Purdue University, pursuing a B.Sc in Data Science and working as an ML Engineer at [DagsHub](https://dagshub.com/).




My primary research interest lies at the intersection of ML theory and intrinsic interpretability; I aim to study and develop methods for leveraging intuitive biases that enable finding backpropagatable parameters that produce emergent learning behaviors while remaining interpretable by design.
