## Hello 👋🏼 I'm Jinen!

I'm a second-year undergraduate @ Purdue University, pursuing a B.Sc in Data Science and working as an ML Engineer at [DagsHub](https://dagshub.com/).

My primary research interest is machine interpretability within the context of Computer Vision and NLP; specifically, building optimization routines based on interpretability techniques.
